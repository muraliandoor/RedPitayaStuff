# RedPitayaStuff
This is a repository of our test stuff with the red pitaya

## burst.py
Contains a function (`waveform()`) sets up one of the fast analog
outputs to generate a waveform from an arbitrary periodic function
with a period of 2pi and a range of [-1, 1]. See the file for an
example use and how it works.

## trace.py
Takes a trace of as many data points as possible over an arbitrary
period and graphs it. Uses the SCPI interface.
